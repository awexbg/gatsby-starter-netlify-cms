  title: Защо света се връща към натуралното
  description: >
    От както съществува земята и е населена с хора ,те са се изхранвали и
    лекували с нейните плодове! Всичко, което е раждала, човека е използвал за
    да може да съществува на нея. С течение на времето е откривал различните
    свойства на растенията и е натрупал хилядолетни познания за тях. В
    различните краища на света поради различният климат са виреели различни
    типове растителност,от които местното население  си е приготвяло храна,
    както и подправки за нея, както и е варило различни отвари и извлеци за
    лечение на болести.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
